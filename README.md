# How to use it

When you fire up the application you are welcomed by the landing page displaying side bar with the company logo and the text fields to fill in your name and the name of the room you want to join and a button to join it.

When you hit the button, the application will ask you for permissions to use the microphone and camera for the call. After you click allow the client will be loaded and you will enter the room.

As more people join you will be able to see their feed and names on the screen. The maximum number of participants is limited to 8.

The room name has to be exactly the same for all the participants or you will join a different room.

Finally for all of this to work you need to have running the token generator API in your computer in order to be authenticated and be able to use the Vidyo API.

For more information on how to run those servers in your machine, go to the repositories:

- [.NET token generator](https://github.com/mateomh/token-generator-dotnet)

- [NodeJS token generator](https://github.com/mateomh/token-generator-nodejs)
